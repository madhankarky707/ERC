ERC-404: Semi-Fungible Token Standard
Overview

ERC-404 is an experimental token standard developed by "ctrl" and "Acme" to introduce a new type of digital asset called "semi-fungible" tokens. These tokens combine the characteristics of both ERC-20 fungible tokens and ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). ERC-404 aims to address the liquidity and flexibility challenges faced by traditional NFTs by allowing them to be fractionally divided and traded.
Features

    Mint-and-Burn Mechanism: ERC-404 operates on a mint-and-burn mechanism, enabling fractional transfers of NFTs. When a complete token is bought, the corresponding NFT is minted; when fractions are sold, the linked NFT is burned.

    Dynamic Ownership: This standard facilitates dynamic ownership of fractional parts of an NFT. New NFTs are automatically minted when a wallet accumulates enough fractions to constitute a complete token.

    Compatibility: ERC-404 is designed to be compatible with existing ERC standards, including ERC-20 and ERC-721, ensuring interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Usage

To use ERC-404, developers can implement the standard in their smart contracts by following the specifications outlined in this document. Contracts utilizing ERC-404 must adhere to the prescribed mint-and-burn mechanism to ensure compatibility and functionality.
Security Considerations

While ERC-404 offers innovative solutions for NFT liquidity and flexibility, developers should exercise caution when implementing this standard. Careful attention should be paid to security considerations to mitigate risks associated with minting, burning, and transferring tokens.
