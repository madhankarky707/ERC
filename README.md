# Token Contracts

## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of token contracts in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens are digital assets that represent value or ownership and can be transferred, traded, or used within decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network.

## Features

- **Fungible Tokens**: Some contracts implement fungible tokens where each token is identical and interchangeable, similar to traditional currencies.
- **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: Other contracts implement non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where each token is unique and not interchangeable, representing ownership of specific assets or collectibles.
- **ERC20 Compatibility**: Certain contracts follow the ERC20 standard, a widely adopted Ethereum token standard that defines a set of rules and functions for fungible tokens.
- **ERC721 Compatibility**: Other contracts follow the ERC721 standard, which is used for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and provides functions for ownership and transfer of unique assets.

## Usage

To use these token contracts in your Ethereum projects, you can deploy them to the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix. Once deployed, you can interact with the token contracts using Ethereum wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), or other Ethereum-based platforms.

### Deployment

To deploy a token contract, follow these general steps:

1. Install Hardhat (or your preferred Ethereum development framework).
2. Compile the Solidity code to generate the contract artifacts.
3. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network of your choice (e.g., local development network, testnet, or mainnet).

### Interacting with the Contracts

Once deployed, you can interact with the token contracts using Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask or by directly calling the contract's functions using Ethereum JSON-RPC libraries like ethers.js or web3.js.

## Testing

This repository includes unit tests for the token contracts to ensure their correctness and functionality. You can run these tests using tools like Hardhat or Truffle to verify that the contracts behave as expected under various conditions.
