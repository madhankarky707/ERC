# ERC721 Token

## Introduction

This repository contains an implementation of an ERC721 token contract in Solidity. ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments) standards are sets of rules and guidelines followed by Ethereum developers when creating smart contracts. ERC721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning each token is unique and not interchangeable.

## ERC Standard

This token contract implements the ERC721 standard, which defines a set of rules and functions that an Ethereum token contract must implement in order to be considered ERC721 compliant. ERC721 tokens represent unique assets or collectibles on the Ethereum blockchain and are often used for digital art, gaming items, and other unique assets.

The ERC721 standard specifies functions such as `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `approve`, `getApproved`, `setApprovalForAll`, `isApprovedForAll`, `transferFrom`, and `safeTransferFrom`, among others. These functions allow users to query token ownership, transfer tokens between accounts, approve third parties to transfer tokens on their behalf, and more.

## Usage

To use this ERC721 token contract in your project, you can deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Hardhat, Truffle, or Remix. Once deployed, you can interact with the token contract using Ethereum wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), or other Ethereum-based platforms.

### Deployment

To deploy the ERC721 token contract, you can use the following steps:

1. Install Hardhat (or your preferred Ethereum development framework).
2. Compile the Solidity code to generate the contract artifacts.
3. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network of your choice (e.g., local development network, testnet, or mainnet).

### Interacting with the Contract

Once deployed, you can interact with the ERC721 token contract using Ethereum wallets such as MetaMask or by directly calling the contract's functions using Ethereum JSON-RPC libraries like ethers.js or web3.js.

## Testing

This repository includes unit tests for the ERC721 token contract to ensure its correctness and functionality. You can run these tests using tools like Hardhat or Truffle to verify that the contract behaves as expected under various conditions.
